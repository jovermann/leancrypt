# leancrypt
This is a lean C++ crypto library.

The goal is to have header-only hashers and other crypto functionality without external dependencies.
Each building block can be used by other projects by just adding one or more header files. 
No binary library and no unnecessary file structure.


## Supported functionality

* SHA-512 hash
